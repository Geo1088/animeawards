# /r/anime awards site

This repository contains the source code for [r-anime.github.io/animeawards](https://r-anime.github.io/animeawards), where each year mods and volunteers of /r/anime compile the year's shows and find out which were the best with the help of the community. The site is a relatively basic Vue application which dynamically loads awards data (which is also contained in this repository).

More info here soon maybe.
